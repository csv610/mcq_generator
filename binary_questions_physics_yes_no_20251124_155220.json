      "question": "Is gravity a force that acts between any two objects with mass?",
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts any two objects with mass toward each other. This is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every mass in the universe pulls every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that any two objects, from apples to planets, exert a gravitational pull on each other, even if the force is extremely small for everyday objects."
